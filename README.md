# Camply ðŸŽ“

Camply is where college students manage everything that matters â€” from exams to events, friends to clubs, all in one place. It's not another study app or social network â€” it's the space built just for your college life. Quiet when you need it, active when you want it. Whether you're trying to pass or make a mark, Camply fits how you move through college.
